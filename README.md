# Backend Software Engineer

We are a car leasing company starting a business with 10 cars.

You need to create a REST API that will:

- handle customers
- associate and disassociate a car to a customer if possible

The API should be dockerized. In production, the service will be replicated (three replicas).

The code should be the cleanest possible.

Stack: Go or python (flask), Dockerfile, sql, test
